* This interface uses the HUD User Data API but is not endorsed or certified by HUD User.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use interface to access
various open source APIs provided by the U.S Housing and Urban Development. 
These include the USPS Crosswalk Files, Fair Markets Rent, Income Limits, and
Comprehensive Housing and Affordability Strategy. Although HUD does provide 
datasets for other programs, they are currently not supported by an API. 

Hopefully they will implement the other ones. 

HUD has two main websites for gaining access to various different data sets:
HUD User and Exchange.

Please read https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/api-terms-of-service.html
for all terms of service.

According to HUD USER:

All services, which utilize or access the API, should display the following
notice prominently within the application: "This product uses the HUD User Data
API but is not endorsed or certified by HUD User." You may use the HUD User name
in order to identify the source of API content subject to these rules. You may
not use the HUD User name, or the like to imply endorsement of any product,
service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise.

## HUD User: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets

"HUD User is an information source containing reports and reference documents 
for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
HUD USER was established by the HUD's Office of Policy Development
and Research in 1978 (HUD User Home Page | HUD USER)."

HUD User maintains an API to gain access to their data. However, their API
system can be rather confusing and provides their information in JSON format 
rather than a data frame like object. Although there exist file downloadables,
R users may want to be able to extract specific bits of the data into memory.

## HUD Exchange: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/drgr/

"The Department of Housing and Urban Development has a website known as HUD
Exchange which is a comprehensive online platform that provides tools,
resources, and contact information for the organizations and individuals that
partner with HUD. These often include nonprofit groups and state and municipal
governments, but also include borrowers, lenders, and brokers involved in HUD’s
multifamily loan programs (Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System, 2022)."

The DRGR Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System which HUD Exchange uses
to supply public data does not have an active API for retrieving information. 
However, there does exist data sets freely available online which can be directly
downloadable into R. This package provides the ability to directly get such data.
