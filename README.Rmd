This package contains an interface to the US Department of Housing and Urban 
Development datasets within R. The goal of this project is to provide an 
easy to use interface to access various open source APIs provided by HUD. 

HUD has two main websites for gaining access to various different data sets:
HUD User and Exchange.

HUD User: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets

HUD Exchange: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/drgr/

"HUD User is an information source containing reports and reference documents 
for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
HUD USER was established by the HUD's Office of Policy Development
and Research in 1978 (Wikipedia contributors, 2021)."

HUD User maintains an API to gain access to their data. However, their API
system can be rather confusing and provides their information in JSON format 
rather than a data frame like object. Although there exist file downloadables,
R users may want to be able to extract specific bits of the data into memory.

"The Department of Housing and Urban Development has a website known as HUD
Exchange which is a comprehensive online platform that provides tools,
resources, and contact information for the organizations and individuals that
partner with HUD. These often include nonprofit groups and state and municipal
governments, but also include borrowers, lenders, and brokers involved in HUD’s
multifamily loan programs (Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System, 2022)."

The DRGR Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System which HUD Exchange uses
to supply public data does not have an active API for retrieving information. 
However, there does exist data sets freely available online which can be directly
downloadable into R. This package provides the ability to directly get such data.

## Available Data

also provide miscellaneous supplemental APIs under them.
