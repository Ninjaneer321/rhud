### Program Overview

"One of the many challenges that social science researchers and practitioners
face is the difficulty of relating United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP codes
to Census Bureau geographies. There are valuable data available only at the
ZIP code level that, when combined with demographic data tabulated at various 
Census geography levels, could open up new avenues of exploration.

While some acceptable methods of combining ZIP codes and Census geography exist,
they have limitations. To provide additional avenues for merging these data,
PD&R has released the HUD-USPS Crosswalk Files. These unique files are derived
from data in the quarterly USPS Vacancy Data. They originate directly from the 
USPS; are updated quarterly, making them highly responsive to changes in ZIP
code configurations; and reflect the locations of both business and residential
addresses. The latter feature is of particular interest to housing researchers
because many of the phenomena that they study are based on housing unit or 
address. By using an allocation method based on residential addresses rather
than by area or by population, analysts can take into account not only the
spatial distribution of population, but also the spatial distribution of
residences. This enables a slightly more nuanced approach to allocating
data between disparate 
geographies (U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development, n.d.)."

These journal articles describe the problem and proposed solution in more detail:

### Census Geographies

This chart provided by the US Census Bureau gives a good example of the
relationships among different geographies. The crosswalk files only support a
subset of these.

### Examples

There are 12 different function for the Crosswalk files:

1) zip-tract [Zip -> Tract][]
2) zip-county [Zip -> County][]
3) zip-cbsa [Zip -> CBSA (Core Base Statistical Areas)][] 
4) zip-cbsadiv (Available 4th Quarter 2017 onwards) [Zip -> CBSAdiv (Core Base Statistical Areas Division)][]
5) zip-cd [ZIP -> CD (Congressional District)][]
6) tract-zip [Tract -> Zip][]
7) county-zip [County -> Zip][]
8) cbsa-zip [CBSA (Core Based Statistical Areas) -> Zip][]
9) cbsadiv-zip (Available 4th Quarter 2017 onwards) [CBSAdiv (Core Based Statistical Areas Division) -> Zip][]
10) cd-zip [CD (Congressional District) -> Zip][]
11) zip-countysub (Available 2nd Quarter 2018 onwards) [Zip -> County Subdistrict][]
12) countysub-zip (Available 2nd Quarter 2018 onwards) [County Subdistrict -> Zip][]

The first GEOID type in the function call is what we want to query for. For example
in #1 above 'zip' is the first GEOID and 'tract' is the second GEOID.

The second GEOID in the function call describes the GEOID which we want to 
determine 'intersection' with the first GEOID where intersection is described
as the % of residential, business, other, and total buildings that overlap. 

For example, in function call #7, we might have a county called 22031 which has zip codes
71052, 71078, 71049, 71032 ... where the residential % of each zip is 0.38,
0.21, 0.11 ... respectively. Of all these zips, when added up will equal 1,
signaling these grouping of zip codes make up 100% of residential address in the
county with each zip taking up their respective percentage.

Disclaimer: Although there exists inverse relationships in the Crosswalk Files,
the measurements are NOT DIRECTLY inverse -- for reasons stated within the papers
above.

These are basic examples which shows you to query the Crosswalk API. Before
looking at the outputted data I RECOMMEND first taking a look at [Input Arguments][]
as well as [Output Data][] located at the bottom of the page.

#### Zip -> Tract
```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(hudr)
# Four digits for printed output. 
options (digits=4)
hud_cw_zip_tract(zip = '35213', year = c('2010'), quarter = c('1'))
```
#### Zip -> County
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_zip_county(zip = 35213, year = c('2020'), quarter = c('2'))
```
#### Zip -> CBSA (Core Base Statistical Areas)
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_zip_cbsa(zip = 35213, year = c('2011'), quarter = c('3'))
```
#### Zip -> CBSAdiv (Core Base Statistical Areas Division)
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_zip_cbsadiv(zip = '22031', year = c('2019'), quarter = c('4'))
```
#### ZIP -> CD (Congressional District)
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_zip_cd(zip = '35213', year = c(2011), quarter = c(1))
```
#### Tract -> Zip 
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_tract_zip(tract = 48201223100, year = c('2017'), quarter = c('1'))
```
#### County -> Zip 
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_county_zip(county = '22031', year = c('2010'), quarter = c('1'))
```
#### CBSA (Core Based Statistical Areas) -> Zip 
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_cbsa_zip(cbsa = '10140', year = c('2017'), quarter = c('2'))
```
#### CBSAdiv (Core Based Statistical Areas Division) -> Zip
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_cbsadiv_zip(cbsadiv = 10380, year = c('2017'), quarter = c('4'))
```
#### CD (Congressional District) -> Zip
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_cd_zip(cd = '2202', year = c('2010'), quarter = c('4'))
```
#### Zip -> County Subdistrict
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_zip_countysub(zip = '35213', year = c('2019'), quarter = c('2'))
```
#### County Subdistrict -> Zip
```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_countysub_zip(countysub = '4606720300 ', year = c('2019', '2019', '2019'), quarter = c('4','4'))
```

#### Querying for only the Crosswalked GEOIDs

If you just want the crosswalked GEOIDs, you can set the MINIMAL argument to TRUE.
This will return a vector containing the crosswalked GEOIDs without the extra metadata.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
hud_cw_county_zip(county = '22031', year = c('2010'), quarter = c('1'), minimal = TRUE)
```

### Input Arguments

1) zip-tract [Zip -> Tract][]
2) zip-county [Zip -> County][]
3) zip-cbsa [Zip -> CBSA (Core Base Statistical Areas)][] 
4) zip-cbsadiv (Available 4th Quarter 2017 onwards) [Zip -> CBSAdiv (Core Base Statistical Areas Division)][]
5) zip-cd [ZIP -> CD (Congressional District)][]
6) tract-zip [Tract -> Zip][]
7) county-zip [County -> Zip][]
8) cbsa-zip [CBSA (Core Based Statistical Areas) -> Zip][]
9) cbsadiv-zip (Available 4th Quarter 2017 onwards) [CBSAdiv (Core Based Statistical Areas Division) -> Zip][]
10) cd-zip [CD (Congressional District) -> Zip][]
11) zip-countysub (Available 2nd Quarter 2018 onwards) [Zip -> County Subdistrict][]
12) countysub-zip (Available 2nd Quarter 2018 onwards) [County Subdistrict -> Zip][]

**QUERY** 

The query argument name is the first geoid in the function call. 
For example, zip-county would have the 'zip' argument name as the query.

Functions #1-5 and #11 must specify a 5 digit zip code in the **zip** function
argument. (Can be type of character or numeric)

  * zip = 22031

Function #6 must specify a 11 digit number consisting of state FIPS + county
FIPS + tract code tract in the **tract** function argument (Can be type of
character or numeric)

  * tract = 51059461700

Function #7 must specify a 5 digit county fip in the **county** function
argument (Can be type of character or numeric)
  
  * county = 51600

Function #8 must specify a micropolitan or metropolitan cbsa code in the
**cbsa** function argument. (Can be type of character or numeric)
  
  * cbsa = 10380
  
Function #9 must specify a metropolitan cbsa division code in the
**cbsadiv** function argument. (Can be type of character or numeric)
  
  * cbsadiv = 35614
  
I recommend typing hud_metropolitan() to see a list of metropolitan CBSA codes.
For example, a code of METRO22900N40079 needs 22900 inside as the input
argument. Micropolitan CBSA codes are allowed. However, HUD does not provide an
API to search available ones.

Function #10 must be a 2 digit state fips code + 2 digit congressional district
in the **cd** function argument. (Can be type of character or numeric)
  
  * cd = 7200

Function #12 must be a 10 digit consisting of 5 digit county fip + 5 digit
county sub district in the **countysub** argument. (Can be type of character or
numeric)

  * countysub = 4606720300
  
**YEAR**: Year range of the data to retrieve. Defaults to current year. (Can be
type of character or numeric)

  * year = c(2019, 2018, 2021)
  * year = c(2016)
  * year = 2021

**QUARTER**: The quarters in the year to retrieve. Defaults to the first
quarter. (Can be type of character or numeric)
  
  * quarter = c(1,2,3,4)
  * quarter = c(1)
  * quarter = 4

**MINIMAL**: If TRUE, returns just the intersecting GEOIDs that are 
crosswalked with the queried geoid.   
  
**KEY**: The API key provided by HUD.

  * key = "wqokqo2138jdi13wfwwfwcytjyr"

    CBSA - ZIP part to the total number of residential addresses in the entire
    Zip, Tract, County, or CBSA. (for type 6-10)


3) **bus_ratio**
    * The ratio of business addresses in the ZIP – Tract, County, or CBSA part
    to the total number of business addresses in the entire ZIP. (for type 1-5).
