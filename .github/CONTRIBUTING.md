### Fixing typos

Typos or grammatical errors in the package may be edited using
the GitHub web interface.

### Prerequisites

Before making substantial pull request, you should file an issue and
get confirmation from a team member. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug.

### Pull request process

*  You should create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  Our team use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  
*  Our team use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the current
development version header describing the changes made followed by your GitHub
username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
