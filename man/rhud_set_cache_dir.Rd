\usage{
rhud_set_cache_dir(path = "NULL", in_wkdir = FALSE, in_home = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The full path to the desired cache directory. Only one can be
set at a time. If no path is specified, it will use the temp directory
for R. The temp directory is not persistent.}

\item{in_wkdir}{Store the path as environment variable in the working directory
.Rprofile so rhud will cache to this specified path.}

\item{in_home}{Store the path as environment variable in the HOME directory
.Rprofile so rhud will cache to this specified path.}
}
\description{
Set the caching directory to store data retrieved using the
rhud API calls. By default, rhud uses a non-persistent temporary directory
given for an R session. However, it is possible that a user might want
to save their queried data in a custom location which is persistent.
This function allows users to set the cache directory. The user can also
store the preferred path in the .RProfile so that rhud will remember the set
preference directory throughout sessions. Make sure the path is valid and
and is not in a sensitive location.

Windows users: please note that you'll need to use double-backslashes or
forward slashes when specifying your cache directory's path in R.
